{
  "SocioEcon": "Socioeconomic standing shapes lifestyle choices and residential environments, indirectly influencing the quality of vehicle maintenance and exposure to urban traffic density.",
  "GoodStudent": "Academic success functions as a psychological proxy for conscientiousness, correlating with lower risk-taking behavior in young drivers.",
  "Age": "Biological age modulates neurological reaction times and physical vulnerability, while also acting as a primary determinant of driving experience and maturity.",
  "RiskAversion": "Inherent psychological tendencies toward caution dictate how a driver prioritizes safety over speed, fundamentally altering the probability of preventable collisions.",
  "VehicleYear": "Manufacturing date determines the baseline of available safety technology and the rate of mechanical wear, affecting both crash avoidance and vehicle value.",
  "Accident": "Sudden kinetic events resulting in vehicular impact serve as the primary causal nodes for all subsequent insurance loss and liability claims.",
  "ThisCarDam": "Physical impairment to the insured vehicle ranges from superficial cosmetic issues to structural failure based on the force of an impact.",
  "RuggedAuto": "Structural robustness and vehicle mass mitigate the severity of damage during collisions, protecting occupants while potentially increasing damage to others.",
  "MakeModel": "Specific engineering standards and manufacturer reputation define the cost of replacement parts and the baseline performance of safety systems.",
  "Antilock": "Computerized braking systems prevent wheel lockup during emergency stops, significantly reducing the likelihood of skidding and loss of control.",
  "Mileage": "Total travel distance represents the temporal and spatial exposure to traffic hazards, directly scaling the statistical likelihood of an incident.",
  "DrivQuality": "Behavioral consistency in obeying traffic laws and maintaining smooth vehicle operation serves as a real-time predictor of imminent risk.",
  "DrivingSkill": "Technical proficiency in vehicle handling and hazard perception allows a driver to successfully navigate complex or dangerous road conditions.",
  "SeniorTrain": "Specialized safety education for older motorists compensates for age-related cognitive decline, reducing their specific risk profile through defensive techniques.",
  "ThisCarCost": "Actual monetary expenditures required to restore the policyholder's vehicle to its pre-accident state depend on part availability and damage severity.",
  "CarValue": "Estimated market price at the time of loss establishes the upper boundary for insurance payouts and determines the feasibility of repairs.",
  "Theft": "Criminal removal of the vehicle results in a total loss claim, driven by local crime rates rather than the driver\u2019s operation of the car.",
  "AntiTheft": "Active security measures like immobilizers and tracking devices decrease the probability of successful theft and lower the associated risk of total loss.",
  "HomeBase": "Geographic parking locations dictate the local environmental risk, including crime density, weather hazards, and typical traffic congestion levels.",
  "OtherCarCost": "Liability payments for damages caused to third-party vehicles are driven by the market value and repair complexity of the other car involved.",
  "PropCost": "Financial obligations arising from damage to non-vehicular objects like fences or buildings contribute to the total severity of a claim.",
  "OtherCar": "Multiple-vehicle involvement increases the complexity of fault determination and multiplies the potential for liability-related costs.",
  "MedCost": "Economic impact of treating physical injuries sustained in a crash varies according to the force of impact and the efficacy of safety features.",
  "Cushioning": "Internal safety materials like padded dashboards absorb kinetic energy, reducing the severity of passenger trauma during a collision.",
  "Airbag": "Automated restraint systems provide a critical buffer during high-impact events, drastically lowering the probability of fatal head or chest injuries.",
  "ILiCost": "Third-party bodily injury liabilities represent the legal and medical costs incurred when a policyholder causes harm to another person.",
  "DrivHist": "Longitudinal records of traffic violations and previous claims provide historical evidence of a driver's consistent risk profile over time."
