  "FntInstlltn": "Availability of font files in the system directory ensures the GDI can access required typeface data. Missing font files cause the OS to substitute the intended font with a default like Arial.",
  "PrntrAccptsTrtyp": "Hardware ability to store or render TrueType outlines directly affects text sharpness and speed. Older printers may require fonts to be sent as slow-to-process bitmaps.",
  "NnTTOK": "Management of bitmap or printer-resident fonts bypasses the standard TrueType rendering pipeline. These fonts rely on the printer's built-in ROM for character generation.",
  "ScrnFntNtPrntrFnt": "Mismatch between displayed fonts and available printer fonts causes unexpected typeface substitutions. This discrepancy leads to different character spacing and line breaks on paper.",
